# influxdb-rails

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/influxdb-rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/influxdb-rails)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/influxdata/influxdb-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/influxdata/influxdb-rails)

Automatically instrument your Ruby on Rails applications and write the
metrics directly into [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.org/).

This gem is designed for Rails 4.0+, Ruby 2.2+ and InfluxDB 0.9+.

## Install

```
$ [sudo] gem install influxdb-rails
```

Or add it to your `Gemfile`, etc.

## Usage

To get things set up, just create an initializer:

```
$ cd /to/you/rails/application
$ touch config/initializers/influxdb_rails.rb
```

In this file, you can configure the `InfluxDB::Rails` adapter. The default
config should look something like this:

``` ruby
InfluxDB::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.influxdb_database = "rails"
  config.influxdb_username = "root"
  config.influxdb_password = "root"
  config.influxdb_hosts    = ["localhost"]
  config.influxdb_port     = 8086

  # config.retry = false
  # config.async = false
  # config.open_timeout = 5
  # config.read_timeout = 30
  # config.max_delay = 300
  # config.time_precision = 'ms'

  # config.tags_middleware = ->(tags) { tags }

  # config.series_name_for_controller_runtimes = "rails.controller"
  # config.series_name_for_view_runtimes       = "rails.view"
  # config.series_name_for_db_runtimes         = "rails.db"
  # config.series_name_for_exceptions          = "rails.exceptions"
  # config.series_name_for_instrumentation     = "instrumentation"

  # Set the application name to something meaningful, by default we
  # infer the app name from the Rails.application class name.
  # config.application_name = Rails.application.class.parent_name
end
```

To see all default values, take a look into `InfluxDB::Rails::Configuration::DEFAULTS`,
defined in `lib/influxdb/rails/configuration.rb`

Out of the box, you'll automatically get reporting of your controller,
view, and db runtimes for each request. You can also call through to the
underlying `InfluxDB::Client` object to write arbitrary data like this:

``` ruby
InfluxDB::Rails.client.write_point "events",
  tags:   { url: "/foo", user_id: current_user.id },
  values: { value: 0 }
```

Additional documentation for `InfluxDB::Client` lives in the
[influxdb-ruby](http://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-ruby) repo.

### Tags

You can modify tags, that are sent to InfluxDB by defining the `tags_middleware`.

```ruby
InfluxDB::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.tags_middleware = lambda do |tags|
    tags.merge(env: Rails.env)
  end
end
```

By default, the following tags are sent for **actions series**:

```ruby
{
  method:   "#{payload[:controller]}##{payload[:action]}",
  server:   Socket.gethostname,
  app_name: configuration.application_name,
}
```

and for the exceptions:

```ruby
{
  application_name:   InfluxDB::Rails.configuration.application_name,
  application_root:   InfluxDB::Rails.configuration.application_root,
  framework:          InfluxDB::Rails.configuration.framework,
  framework_version:  InfluxDB::Rails.configuration.framework_version,
  language:           "Ruby",
  language_version:   "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}",
  custom_data:        @custom_data,
  class:    @exception.class.to_s,
  method:   "#{@controller}##{@action}",
  filename: File.basename(@backtrace.lines.first.try(:file)),
  server:   Socket.gethostname,
  status:   "open",
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions


**Q: I'm seeing far less requests recorded in InfluxDB than my logs suggest.**

By default, this gem only sends data points with *second time precision*
to the InfluxDB server. If you experience multiple requests per second,
**only the last** point (with the same tag set) is stored.

See [InfluxDB server docs][duplicate-points] for further details.
To work around this limitation, set the `config.time_precision` to one
of `"ms"` (milliseconds, 1·10<sup>-3</sup>s), `"us"` (microseconds,
1·10<sup>-6</sup>s) or `"ns"` (nanoseconds, 1·10<sup>-9</sup>s).

[duplicate-points]: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.4/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#how-does-influxdb-handle-duplicate-points


**Q: How does the measurement influence the response time?**

This gem subscribes to the `process_action.action_controller` controller
notification (via `ActiveSupport::Notifications` · [guide][arn-guide] ·
[docs][arn-docs] · [impl][arn-impl]), i.e. it runs *after* a controller
action has finished.

The thread processing incoming HTTP requests however is blocked until
the notification is processed. By default, this means calculating and
enqueueing some data points for later processing (`config.async = true`),
which usually is negligible. The asynchronuous sending happens in a seperate
thread, which batches multiple data points.

If you, however, use a synchronous client (`config.async = false`), the
data points are immediately sent to the InfluxDB server. Depending on
the network link, this might cause the HTTP thread to block a lot longer.

**Q: How does this gem handle an unreachable InfluxDB server?**

By default, the InfluxDB client will retry indefinetly, until a write
succeedes (see [client docs][] for details). This has two important
implcations, depending on the value of `config.async`:

- if the client runs asynchronously (i.e. in a seperate thread), the queue
  might fill up with hundrets of megabytes of data points
- if the client runs synchronously (i.e. inline in the request/response
  cycle), it might block all available request threads

In both cases, your application server might become inresponsive and needs
to be restarted (which can happen automatically in `cgroups` contexts).

If you setup a maximum retry value (`Integer === config.retry`), the
client will try upto that amount of times to send the data to the server
and (on final error) log an error and discard the values.

[client docs]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-ruby#retry


**Q: What happens with unwritten points, when the application restarts?**

The data points are simply discarded.


**Q: What happens, when the InfluxDB client or this gem throws an exception? Will the user see 500 errors?**

No. The controller instrumentation is wrapped in a `rescue StandardError`
clause, i.e. this gem will only write the error to the `client.logger`
(`Rails.logger` by default) and not disturb the user experience.
